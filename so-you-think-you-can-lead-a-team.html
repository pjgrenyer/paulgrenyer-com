              When I first met Paul as a fellow software engineer I can't say I'd have immediately identified him as a
              future team leader. Though it might not sound like one, this is a resounding recommendation for his book
              on team leading. It isn't a role Paul went into with all the skills already under his belt. I doubt many
              people do. What matters is that he has paid attention, reflected and, most importantly, cared passionately
              about learning how to be the leader his teams deserve. He's learned by careful observation, and in this
              book he shares what he's learned, making it a really practical guide for others to follow in his
              footsteps.

              As a topic, team leadership has the potential for dryness, platitudes and eye-glazing, but Paul tells it
              differently. This is a book told from the heart and from the trenches. Leadership is built on a foundation
              of communication that is compassionate, considered and continuous. Developers and development
              organisations often get wrapped up in a narrow view of their work, but there is more of value than just
              the work. And, to lead, Paul reminds you leadership is about teamwork not leaderwork, focus on delegation
              not control, distributing work rather than hoarding it. Delivered with stories, experience and honesty,
              Paul paints the bigger picture with fine brushstrokes.
